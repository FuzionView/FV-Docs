FuzionView Documentation
=========================
FuzionView software aggregates all utility location data (GIS) into a single map “on the fly”. This provides engineering design teams, facility operators, locators, excavators and homeowners with an unprecedented view of the underground utilities at the site, providing the opportunity for a safer, more efficient approach to each project. Each map is provided as part of an 811 ticket and is limited to the excavation area, plus a 100 foot buffer. The software is easy for facility operators to implement, and data is only available to authorized users.

The FuzionView documentation has four audiences:

**End User Documentation** is for homeowners, locators, excavators, and design Engineers who are ticket owners that want to use the FuzionView Ticket Viewer.

**Data Provider Documentation** is for facility owners and other data providers who need to configure datasets and users to manage their data.

**System Operator Documentation** is for the GIS or IT staff at an 811 system operator who need to install and configure the FuzionView system.

**Developer Documentation** is for those who wish to use the FuzionView Core Engine to build their own product.
