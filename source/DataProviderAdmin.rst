   This document will be updated with content from the System Operator Admin Guide once the project is completed. The current content is just a placeholder.

The Data Provider Admin is the Account management interface for Facility Operators and other Data Providers. From this menu you can create and manage all datasets and users. 

Datasets
----------

Use the Admin interface to view all the datasets that have been configured for your facility.

**Add Dataset**
After the system operator initiates your Data Provider profile, you can open Datasets from the Data Provider Admin in the menu to configure your datasets.
