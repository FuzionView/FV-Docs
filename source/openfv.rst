Starting FuzionView
====================

FuzionView is currently in Beta testing. There are two ways to access the tool:
 * With a known GSOC ticket number
 * From the GeoMoose application, without a ticket number

I have a ticket number
-----------------------
To access the Ticket Viewer with a ticket number, start at:

https://uumpt.sharedgeo.net/dist/?ticketNumber=240041209.

In the address bar, replace the example ticket number with your ticket number and hit enter to open the desired ticket.

I need to find a ticket number

If you don't have a ticket number to test, use the GeoMoose application to select a ticket. 

Begin on the UUMPT site: https://uumpt.sharedgeo.net
