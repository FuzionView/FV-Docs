FuzionView Documentation
=====================================

Revolutionizing Underground Utility Safety

A unique public-private effort to advance geospatial technology which will:
* Save lives
* Improve business efficiency
* Dramatically reduce construction costs
* Address well-known community deficiencies
* Pave the way for advanced technologies which will save even more lives.


Overview
---------
FuzionView software aggregates all utility location data (GIS) into a single map “on the fly”.  This provides engineering design teams, facility operators, locators, excavators, and homeowners with an unprecedented view of the site's underground utilities, providing the opportunity for a safer, more efficient approach to each project.  Each map is provided as part of an 811 One Call ticket and is limited to the excavation area plus a 100 foot buffer.  The software is simple for facility operators to implement, and the utility data is secure from unauthorized use.

Audience
---------

This documentation has four audiences:

* End User Documentation is for homeowners, locators, excavators, and design Engineers who are ticket owners that want to use the FuzionView Ticket Viewer.
* Data Provider Documentation is for facility owners and other data providers who need to configure datasets and users to manage their data.
* System Operator Documentation is for the GIS or IT staff at an 811 system operator who need to install and configure the FuzionView system.
* Developer Documentation is for those who wish to use the FuzionView Core Engine to build their own product.

 intended to assist in using FuzionView, installing and configuring FuzionView by the IT staff at a System Operator, Facility Owner, or other data provider, as well as developers who are interested in building functionality using the FuzionView Core Engine.
