FuzionView Open Source Documentation
=====================================

Revolutionizing Underground Utility Safety

A unique public-private effort to advance geospatial technology which will:
* Save lives
* Improve business efficiency
* Dramatically reduce construction costs
* Address well-known community deficiencies
* Pave the way for advanced technologies which will save even more lives.


Overview
---------
FuzionView software aggregates all utility location data (GIS) into a single map “on the fly”.  This provides engineering design teams, facility operators, locators, excavators and homeowners with an unprecedented view of the site's underground utilities, providing the opportunity for a safer, more efficient approach to each project.  Each map is provided as part of a one call ticket and is limited to the excavation area.  The software is simple for facility operators to implement, and the utility is secure from unauthorized use.

Audience
---------

This documentation is intended to assist in installing and configuring FuzionView by the IT staff at a System Operator, or a Facility Owner or other data provider, as well as developers who are interested in building functionality using the FuzionView Core Engine.
