About this graphic:
The 811 ticket originates from the Minnesota Gopher State One Call service, managed by OCC. XML data is pushed to FuzionView core engine which initiates a request for data from established data connections. This information is collected and compiled into a features map that can be viewed and manipulated in the FuzionView Ticket Viewer. System Operators can add new data providers, data providers can add new datasets and authorize access to their data.
