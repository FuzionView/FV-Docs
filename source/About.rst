About FuzionView
==================
A unique public-private effort to advance geospatial mapping technology which will:
 * Save Lives
 * Improve Business Efficiency
 * Reduce Construction Costs
 * Address a Community Deficiency
 * Pave the Way for the Future

FuzionView software aggregates all utility location data (GIS) into a single map “on the fly”.  This provides engineering design teams, facility operators, locators, excavators and homeowners with an unprecedented view of the site's underground utilities, providing the opportunity for a safer, more efficient approach to each project.  Each map is provided as part of a one call ticket and is limited to the excavation area.  The software is simple for facility operators to implement, and the utility is secure from unauthorized use.

Background
===========

In 2017, representatives of Gopher State One Call (GSOC) reached out to the leadership of Emergency Preparedness Committee of the Minnesota Geospatial Advisory Council (EPC) in hopes of learning what could potentially be done to improve the use of geospatial technology in the underground utility community. From ensuing discussions over the next three years, the Underground Utilities Mapping Project Team (UUMPT) came into existence under the auspices of the EPC in early 2020. Now comprised of over 25 individuals from various sectors of the underground Facility Operator (FO) community, since mid-2021 the UUMPT has been championing development of software called "FuzionView". In October 2022, a FuzionView prototype successfully demonstrated the ability to pull together an on-the-fly, web-mapped view, of all utility infrastructure within a designated dig area. This was a first in the nation achievement.

In 2023, GSOC hired Minnesota geospatial research and development nonprofit SharedGeo to develop a production version of FuzionView which will be used across Minnesota and released as Open Source software.  Together, these project partners, as well as others who are joining the effort, are working to leverage 50-years of advancements in geospatial technologies that have been previously under-utilized in the underground utility community.
