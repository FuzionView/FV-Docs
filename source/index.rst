FuzionView Documentation 
=========================

FuzionView software aggregates all utility location data (GIS) into a single map “on the fly”. Engineering design teams, facility operators, locators, excavators and homeowners have an unprecedented view of the underground utilities at the site, providing the opportunity for a safer, more efficient approach to each project. FuzionView maps supplement the 811 ticket and are limited to the excavation area, plus a 100 foot buffer. Facility operators can quickly share their datasets and have control to disable access at any time. Map and feature data is only available to authorized users.

Select the documentation that is right for you:

**End Users** Guide homeowners, locators, excavators, and design Engineers to view their tickets in the FuzionView Ticket Viewer.

**Data Providers** Guide facility owners and other data providers to connect, authorize, and manage shared datasets.

**System Operators** Guide 811 system operator IT/GIS staff to implement and administer a FuzionView server.

**Developers** Guide to leveraging the FuzionView Core Engine open source product.
