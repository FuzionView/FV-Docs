FuzionView Documentation
=========================
FuzionView software aggregates all utility location data (GIS) into a single map “on the fly”. This provides engineering design teams, facility operators, locators, excavators and homeowners with an unprecedented view of the underground utilities at the site, providing the opportunity for a safer, more efficient approach to each project. Each map is provided as part of an 811 ticket and is limited to the excavation area, plus a 100 foot buffer. The software is easy for facility operators to implement, and data is only available to authorized users.
